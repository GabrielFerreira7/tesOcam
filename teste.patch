-
-This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
-published from being rewound.
-
-The workflow assumed here is:
-
- * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
-   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
-
- * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
-   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
-   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
-   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
-   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
-
- * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
-   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
-
-The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
-to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
-$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
-
-With this workflow, you would want to know:
-
-(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
-    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
-    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
-    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
-    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
-    not want to rewind it.
-
-(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
-    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
-    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
-    change things related to the topic as patches against your
-    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
-    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
-    tip of "master".
-
-Let's look at this example:
-
-		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
-		  /       /           /           /
-		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
-		/   /               /           /

-A, B and C are topic branches.
-
- * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
-
- * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
-   and is ready to be deleted.
-
- * C has not merged to "next" at all.
-
-We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
-B to be deleted.
-
-To compute (1):
-
-	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
-	git rev-list ^master        next
-
-	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
-
-To compute (2):
-
-	git rev-list master..topic
-
-	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

-# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
-#
-# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
-# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
-# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
-# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
-# updateInstead.
-#
-# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
-# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
-# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
-# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
-# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
-# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
-# as a starting point for convenient modification.
-#
-# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
-# branch is going to be updated:
-commit=$1
-
-# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
-# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
-die () {
-	echo >&2 "$*"
-	exit 1
-}
-
-# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
-# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
-# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
-#
-# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
-# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
-# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
-# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
-# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
-# not interfere with the difference between the branches.
-
-# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
-# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
-# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
-#
-# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
-# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
-# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
-# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

-# Welcome
-
-Working with a simple OCaml project using `opam` and `dune`.
-
-This project implements a library and an application to greet the user with a message.
-
-There is a video explaining the project in the Moodle virtual classroom for the course. Watch it.
-
-## Exercise
-
-Modify the project to add a question to the user, asking his year of birth, read the answer, and then display the user age.
-
-You will need an aditional library to compute the age of the user, because the standard library does not have this functionality. Use the library [`ptime`](https://erratique.ch/software/ptime/doc/Ptime.html), which has platform independent support for POSIX time.
-
-- With the help of `opam`, install the `ptime` package in your system, if needed.
-- Modify the `dune-project` to add a dependence on the package `ptime` to the project.
-- Modify the `lib/dune` file to list the dependence libraries `ptime` and `ptime.clock.os` in the `library` stanza:
-  ``` dune
-    (libraries ptime ptime.clock.os)
-  ```
-- Add a function `get_age` to the module `Mylib.Hello`.
-  - This function should returns the number of years from a given year to the current year.
-  - Use the library [`ptime`](https://erratique.ch/software/ptime/doc/Ptime.html) to handle dates:
-     - `Ptime_clock.now` can be used to get the current POSIX timestamp of the system.
-     - `Ptime.to_date_time` can be used to extract the date and time of a given timestamp.
-     - Use pattern matching to extract the year from the result of `Ptime.to_date_time`. Put something like the following code snippet *inside your `get_age` function*:
-       ``` ocaml
-       let get_age ... =
-         ...
-         let just_now = Ptime_clock.now ()
-         let ((current_year, _, _), _) = Ptime.to_date_time just_now
-         ...
-       ```
-  - Do not forget to add this new function to the interface of the module `Mylib.Hello`.
-- Modify the application to:
-  - ask the year of birth of the user,
-  - read the answer, and
-  - calculate and print the age
-- Build and test the application.
-- When ready, submit your solution to your private repository in github.

--
--This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
--published from being rewound.
--
--The workflow assumed here is:
--
-- * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
--   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
--
-- * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
--   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
--   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
--   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
--   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
--
-- * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
--   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
--
--The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
--to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
--$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
--
--With this workflow, you would want to know:
--
--(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
--    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
--    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
--    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
--    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
--    not want to rewind it.
--
--(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
--    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
--    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
--    change things related to the topic as patches against your
--    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
--    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
--    tip of "master".
--
--Let's look at this example:
--
--		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
--		  /       /           /           /
--		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
--		/   /               /           /
--	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
--	      /   /   /             \         /
--	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
--	    /   /   /   /             \     /
--    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
--
--
--A, B and C are topic branches.
--
-- * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
--
-- * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
--   and is ready to be deleted.
--
-- * C has not merged to "next" at all.
--
--We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
--B to be deleted.
--
--To compute (1):
--
--	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
--	git rev-list ^master        next
--
--	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
--
--To compute (2):
--
--	git rev-list master..topic
--
--	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

--#!/bin/sh
--
--# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
--#
--# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
--# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
--# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
--# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
--# updateInstead.
--#
--# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
--# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
--# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
--# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
--# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
--# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
--# as a starting point for convenient modification.
--#
--# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
--# branch is going to be updated:
--commit=$1
--
--# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
--# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
--die () {
--	echo >&2 "$*"
--	exit 1
--}
--
--# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
--# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
--# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
--#
--# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
--# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
--# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
--# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
--# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
--# not interfere with the difference between the branches.
--
--# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
--# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
--# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
--#
--# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
--# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
--# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
--# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

--# Welcome
--
--Working with a simple OCaml project using `opam` and `dune`.
--
--This project implements a library and an application to greet the user with a message.
--
--There is a video explaining the project in the Moodle virtual classroom for the course. Watch it.
--
--## Exercise
--
--Modify the project to add a question to the user, asking his year of birth, read the answer, and then display the user age.
--
--You will need an aditional library to compute the age of the user, because the standard library does not have this functionality. Use the library [`ptime`](https://erratique.ch/software/ptime/doc/Ptime.html), which has platform independent support for POSIX time.
--
--- With the help of `opam`, install the `ptime` package in your system, if needed.
--- Modify the `dune-project` to add a dependence on the package `ptime` to the project.
--- Modify the `lib/dune` file to list the dependence libraries `ptime` and `ptime.clock.os` in the `library` stanza:
--  ``` dune
--    (libraries ptime ptime.clock.os)
--  ```
--- Add a function `get_age` to the module `Mylib.Hello`.
--  - This function should returns the number of years from a given year to the current year.
--  - Use the library [`ptime`](https://erratique.ch/software/ptime/doc/Ptime.html) to handle dates:
--     - `Ptime_clock.now` can be used to get the current POSIX timestamp of the system.
--     - `Ptime.to_date_time` can be used to extract the date and time of a given timestamp.
--     - Use pattern matching to extract the year from the result of `Ptime.to_date_time`. Put something like the following code snippet *inside your `get_age` function*:
--       ``` ocaml
--       let get_age ... =
--         ...
--         let just_now = Ptime_clock.now ()
--         let ((current_year, _, _), _) = Ptime.to_date_time just_now
--         ...
--       ```
--  - Do not forget to add this new function to the interface of the module `Mylib.Hello`.
--- Modify the application to:
--  - ask the year of birth of the user,
--  - read the answer, and
--  - calculate and print the age
--- Build and test the application.
--- When ready, submit your solution to your private repository in github.
